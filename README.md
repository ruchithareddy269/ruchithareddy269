## üöÄ Projects  

- [**LLM Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Poetry**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wacaZSGsG9i5kS-YFBcO5PE2m61Z_5mw?usp=drive_link):  
  Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model integrated with external databases to enhance content retrieval precision by 45% and generate rich, contextually meaningful poetry.  

- [**Canvas Learning Management System**](https://github.com/ruchithareddy269/202-project):  
  Designed and implemented a Learning Management System to manage educational courses, assignments, and user roles efficiently. This project demonstrates robust backend logic and a user-friendly frontend interface.  

- [**Harnessing Language Models for Insightful Macroeconomic Analysis from User-Driven Prompts**](https://github.com/ruchithareddy269/cmpe256-Hackathon):  
  Developed a system leveraging advanced language models to analyze macroeconomic data and provide insights based on user-defined prompts. This project showcases the practical application of AI in economics.  

- [**Book Recommendation System**](https://github.com/ruchithareddy269/256-Project-Book_Recommendation_System):  
  Built a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering and natural language processing techniques to suggest books based on user preferences and past interactions.  

- [**Forecasting Bicycle Rentals: Time-Series Analysis**](https://github.com/ruchithareddy269/255-Final-Project):  
  Utilized time-series analysis to predict bicycle rental volumes based on factors such as weather conditions, temperature, and seasonal trends. This project focused on identifying key factors influencing rental patterns and delivering accurate forecasts.  

- [**HR Portal Project**](https://github.com/ruchithareddy269/CMPE-272-HR-portal-Project):  
  Developed a microservices-based HR portal using AngularJS, Node.js, Kafka, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. Features include JWT authentication, Okta SSO integration, and a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployment.  

- [**Human Action Recognition**](https://github.com/ruchithareddy269/258-Deep_learning-Project):  
  Developed and compared models (CNN, CNN-RNN, Transformers) for recognizing human actions from videos, achieving high accuracy with CNN, and deployed the system using Gradio for real-time predictions.

- [**Generating API documentation using LLM**](https://github.com/ruchithareddy269/Generating-API-Documentation-using-LLM):  
  A CLI tool for generating API documentation using Large Language Models (LLM), supporting both bulk and API-by-API documentation generation modes.
